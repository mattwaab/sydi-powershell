## INSTALLATION

SYDI-Server isn't a software you install, you just unzip the file and go to the directory in a shell and write:

cscript.exe sydi-server.vbs -h

## DEPENDENCIES

The tools are written to not require any specific software as most of the components should be built into Windows.

However to creating a report in Word or an overview file in Excel requires those programs to be installed on the computer where you are creating the report. I.e. not the computers you are targeting.
